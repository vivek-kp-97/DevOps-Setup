        && echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
        | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
        && sudo apt update \
        && sudo apt install ngrok
  - Setup/Configure ngrok aut token using 'ngrok config add-authtoken <authtoken>'. Where the auth token can be obtained from the ngrok website.
  - Use 'ngrok http http://localhost:8080' to obtain a public url for a service running locally at port 8080.
